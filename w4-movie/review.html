                <p><b>Brett Berard</b> <i>Feburary 7,2022</i></p>

                <p><i>Interstellar</i> is a fantastic movie that uses space travel to convey a strong message about human connection. This movie strikes a good balance between drama and action.
               <br><br> Although this movie is definelty more focused on the characters and their emotions it still has very suspensful action scenes that make the movie very intresting to watch. The suspense created throughout the movie<br><br> One thing that truly makes this movie amazing is the soundtrack to it. Hans Zimmer created an amazing soundtrack the perfectly fits the theme of space. </p>
